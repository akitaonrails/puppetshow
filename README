== Puppet Show

Puppet Show is a very simple front-end for Puppet. This is an initial
maintenance version, with few tweaks to make it work. This is based on
Rails 2.0.2 and Hobo 0.7.5.

To make it work, first clone this project:

  git clone git://github.com/akitaonrails/puppetshow

Then install the dependencies:

  sudo gem install rails --version=2.0.2
  sudo gem install puppet facter
  cd puppetshow
  sudo gem install gems/hobosupport-0.7.5.gem
  sudo gem install gems/hobofield-0.7.5.gem

Configure your config/database.yml and migrate:

  rake db:migrate

This should be enough to have the project up and running:

  ./script/server

Obs: this project depends on a proper /etc/puppet/puppet.conf already
configured. I am still now certain on all the details, but check out
the config/environment.rb to make sure they are still valid.

== TODO

This project lacks testing. We need to delete the /test folder altogether
and start a new 'features'  and 'spec' one.

The Hobo and ActiveScaffold could be removed. It adds unnecessary 
complexity to this project.

We need upgrade it to use Rails 2.3.x or higher, the 2.0.2 version is 
already too old.
